# odin_rock_paper_scissors

This is the first project from Odin Project - Foundation Course, JavaScript chapter.
Here, I will be creating rock, paper, scissors game using JavaScript only.
The game is played between a user and the computer.
At the start of each round, a prompt box will appear for the user to type in either rock, papaer, or scissors. The input will be case insensitive.
At the end of each round, the result of the round and each player's score will be shown on a new prompt box.
The game will end after five rounds or when one player wins three rounds first.
